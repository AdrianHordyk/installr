Description: The installr package aims at making the process of updating R on windows as easy as possible,
   the main function for this purpose is the update.R() function.
   Also, the package contains a set of functions allowing useRs to install new softwares (on Windows OS) using R.
   While for Linux users, the installation process of new software may be 
   just running a short line of code, for the regular Windows user it often includes browsing online,
   finding the latest version, downloading it, running the installer, and
   deleting the installation file. All of these steps are automatically done
   using functions in this package.
