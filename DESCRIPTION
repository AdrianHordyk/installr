Description: R is great for installing software.  Through the 'installr' 
   package you can automate the updating of R (on Windows) and install new 
   software (currently only for Windows OS).   
   Software installation is initiated through a gui (just run installr()), or
   through functions such as: install.Rtools(), install.pandoc(), install.git(),
   and many more.    
   As for updating R, simply run updateR(). Motivation: While for Linux users, 
   the installation process of new software may be simply running a short
   line of code, for the regular Windows user it often includes browsing online, 
   finding the latest version, downloading it, running the installer, 
   and deleting the installation file. 
   All of these steps are automatically done using functions in this package.
