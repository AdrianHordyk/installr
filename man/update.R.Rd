\description{
  This function performs the following steps: \itemize{
  \item Check what is the latest R version.  If the current
  installed R version is up-to-date, the function ends (and
  returns FALSE) \item If a newer version of R is
  available, the user is asked if to review the NEWS of the
  latest R version - in order to decide if to install the
  newest R or not. \item If the user wishes to - the
  function will download and install it. (you will need to
  press the "next" buttons on your own) \item Once the
  installation is done, you should press "any-key", and the
  function will proceed with copying all of your packages
  from your old (well, current) R installation, into your
  newer R installation. \item You can then erase all of the
  packages in your old R installation. \item After your
  packages are moved (and the old ones possibly erased),
  you will get the option to update all of your packages in
  the new version of R. \item Lastely - you can close the
  current session of your old R. }
